# Restaurant Management System (RMS)

A robust, scalable web application designed to streamline and manage the core operations of a restaurant, built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.

## üåü Features

This project's structure covers key restaurant operations:

* **User & Authentication (`account`)**: Secure user registration, login, and **Role-Based Access Control** (e.g., Owner, Manager, Staff).
* **Menu & Inventory (`products`)**: **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for menu items and basic **inventory tracking** for stock.
* **Order Management (`orders`)**: System for placing, viewing, and updating the status of customer orders (e.g., Pending, Preparing, Ready).
* **Core Logic (`restaurant_management`)**: Central configuration and global business logic (e.g., reporting, shift management).
* **Utilities (`utils`)**: Reusable code, helper functions, and custom mixins shared across the application.
